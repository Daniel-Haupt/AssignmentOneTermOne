Report to explain in detail the purpose of the app, design considerations and the utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions:

  The purpose of this application is to give the my friend "Hera" an easy way to decide what she should eat on her busy days during different times of the day.

  I've chosen to keep the design of the application very simple and user friendly. The background is a wooden lunch table top. The input field I decided to put a the top followed
  by a hint text, so that the user knows which inputs to put in instead of having to guess, followed by an open space prepared for the output after the user presses a button.
  The 2 buttons continue and reset spaced at the bottom of the emulator / screen. Continue executing code and Reset resetting the interface.

  We use the help of GitHub to take our code and export it to GitHub so that it can be viewed, downloaded by different people.
